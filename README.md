# Hello C++

This repository is to demonstrate a very simple C++ program with unit testing. It is not intended to demonstrate C++ programming skills but to be used as a demo of an ability to remotely pull, test, and package C++ code. It is intended to be used in conjunction with my [Jenkins playground](https://github.com/stuc2010/jenkins-playground) to demonstrate DevOps skills.
